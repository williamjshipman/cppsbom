## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Extend CLI parsing and usage text to accept `--include-internal`.
- [x] 1.2 Thread the option through scan pipelines (Visual Studio and CMake) to control internal dependency filtering.
- [x] 1.3 Update dependency classification to include internal includes/imports/libraries when enabled.
- [x] 1.4 Add tests for default and include-internal behavior (create a test project if needed).
